            # Cool part comes here - Generator functions
              & It doesn't follow the "run-to-completion" model!

                - Does this mean that we can randomly pause a generator function in the middle of executing it? Well, sort of!

        ^ function* generatorFunction() {...}

        ? Generator functions actually work in a completely different way compared to regular functions

          $ Invoking generator function returns a generator object, which is an iterator

          $ We can use the 'yield' keyword in a generator function to "pause" the execution


          * We invoke a regular function, the function body gets executed and eventually returns a value!

          * When we invoke a generator function, a generator object gets returned!

            ^ We can use the 'yield' keyword in a generator function to "pause" the execution

              function generatorFunction() {
                yield '1';

                console.log('Second log!');
                return 'Done!';
              }

              ? The execution of the generator gets "paused" when it encounters a yield keyword
                  & The best thing is that the next time we run the function, it remembered where it previously paused, and runs from there on!

              - 1. 'yield' -> pauses and yields the string value

              - 2. From 'previous yield' -> second 'yield' keyword and yields the value

              - 3. From 'previous yield' -> returns the value 'Done!'

              ! Generator contains a 'next' method on the prototype chain

                ^ Will use this to iterate the generate object

                  * In order to remember the state of where it previously left off after yielding a value, we need to assign the generator object to a variable...

                  const generatorObj = generatorFunction();

                  generatorObj.next(); // { value: '1', done: false }

                    # The generator ran until it encountered the first "yield" keyword

                      $ It yielded an object containing a value property, and a done property
                        { value: ..., done: ... }

                        ? The value property is equal to the value that we yielded

                        ? The done property is a boolean value, which is only set to true once the generator function returned a value (not yielded! ðŸ˜Š)

                        ^ We stopped iterating over the generator, which makes it look like the function just paused! How cool is that.

              * Let's invoke the next method again!

                generatorObj.next();
                  ? This is neither a yield nor return keyword, so it continues!
                    - // 'First log!'
                    - // { value: '2', done: false }

                       - // 'Second log!'
                      - // { value: 'Done', done: true }

                    $ We actually returned this time, so the value of done is set to true!

            ! The done property is actually very important. We can only iterate a generator object once

            ^ What?! So what happens when we call the next method again?
